\subsection Overview

The V2-Fun package is a C++ tool for computing fully developed channel flow using a v2-f model. This code was written as a final project for CSE380, and makes use of the following design principles:

The latest version of v2fun can be download <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/v2fun_Yalla.tar">here</a>. The current release of v2fun includes the .git directory for completion, which accounts for a majority of the files. The code is written in C++ and makes use of the external libraries <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a> and <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~csim/grvy/html/index.html">GRVY</a>. The code should be run on Stampede at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. To aid in usage and installation, please see the related pages:

\subsection doc Other Documentation

The model documentation can be found <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/writeup-paper.pdf">here</a>. Several of the variable names in the code follow the naming scheme used in that document. This doxygen page details each header file and class in the source code that is included by `main.cpp'. Lastely, a beamer presentation thoroughly detailing each design feature can be found <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/talk.pdf">here</a>.  

\subsection bugs Reporting Comments and Bugs

Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can be reported to gopal@ices.utexas.edu. Requests and contributions (and good grades) are welcome at the same e-mail address.

\subsection note Notice 

The current version of v2fun doesn't fully work just yet (hence the `fun' part, because I still had a lot of fun making it!) On most runs of the code, the viscous dissipation term goes nagative resulting in NANs when computing the turbulent length and time scale. However, the code will run as is, since time marching is disabled, and instead the temporal step size is made extremely small and only one iteration of the solver is performed to ensure the dissipation terms stays positive. The README file contains instructions on how to enable time marching. I believe the error in v2fun may be related to the following problems:

<ul>
<li> The initial guess derived by interpolating DNS data may be off for the v2-f model so gsl's Newton solver is diverging. 
<li> The approximation to the Jacobian in gsl's multiroot solver is not sufficient for this problem. 
<li> The model constants need to be corrected, or perhaps a CFL condition is not satisfied by the step sizes. 
</ul>

We hope to fix this bug in a future release, as well as implement regression tests such as asymptotic error analysis, convergence of certain statistical quantities, and a method of manufactured solution.
