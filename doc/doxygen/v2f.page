\subsection Overview

The V2-Fun package is a tool for computing fully developed channel flow using a v2-f model. This code was originally written as a final project for Dr. Chris Simmon's <em>Tools and Techniques of Computational Science</em> class and later updted for Dr. Robert Moser's <em>Turbulence</em> class, with the help of Clark Peterson, Tim Smith, and Sean Carney. The latest version of v2fun can be download <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/v2fun_Yalla.tar">here</a>. The code is written in C++ and makes use of the external libraries <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a> and <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~csim/grvy/html/index.html">GRVY</a>. To aid in usage and installation, please see the related pages:

\subsection doc Other Documentation

The model documentation can be found <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/writeup-paper.pdf">here</a>. Several of the variable names in the code follow the naming scheme used in that document. This doxygen page details each header file and class in the source code that is included by `main.cpp'. Lastely, a beamer presentation thoroughly detailing each design feature can be found <a href="http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/talk.pdf">here</a>.  

\subsection bugs Reporting Comments and Bugs

Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can be reported to gopal@ices.utexas.edu. Requests and contributions (and good grades) are welcome at the same e-mail address.

\subsection ex Example

Below are results obtained using v2fun. The figures show the profiles for Reynolds Number = 180,2000,5200,10000, the log-law for Re=10000, and the terms in the v2f model for Re=5200,10000, respectively.

\subsection note Notice 

We hope to implement regression tests such as asymptotic error analysis, convergence of certain statistical quantities, and a method of manufactured solution in the future.
