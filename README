README
	V2-FUN is a tool for computing fully developed channel flow using a v2-f
	model...made fun! The code is written in C++ and makes use of external
	libraries including gsl, boost, and grvy. For more information about the
	features in v2fun as well as installation and usage instructions, please
	visit the website:

			http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/html/	
	
	The usage and installation information is repeated below. 
	
INSTALLATION

	After loading the requisite libraries, issue a make command in the root
	directory to see all available targets, i.e., 

	> make 
	Available make targets:
  	all       : build main program in /src/
    	check     : build and run test unit test suite in /test/unit
      	coverage  : build tests w/ coverage option, run lcov, and generate html in 
			/test/unit/lcov_html
        doc       : build documentation (doxygen page, and writeup)

	To install v2fun in the src/ directory run, 

	> make all

	To verify that the software is working properly, a test option is provided
	to run a short suite of functionality tests against the local
	build. To run, issue a 'make check' to initiate the tests.  If
	succesful, output similar to the following will be generated:

	--------------------------------------------------
	Running Unit Test Suite
	--------------------------------------------------

	PASS: Interpolation Test
	PASS: Saving results
	PASS: Compute Turbulent Time Scale, T
	PASS: Compute Turbulent Length Scale, L
	PASS: Compute Eddy Viscosity, vT
	PASS: Compute Production Rate, P
	PASS: Compute Dissipation at Wall
	PASS: Compute redistribution at Wall
	PASS: Setting U terms in system
	PASS: Setting k terms in system
	PASS: Setting ep terms in system
	PASS: Setting v2 terms in system
	PASS: Setting f terms in system
	PASS: Putting system together
	--------------------------------------------------

	Finally, to check the code coverage of the unit tests, issuing a 'make
	coverage' command will run lcov on the test suite and save the converage
	info and html files in the directory /test/unit/, as follows:

	> make coverage 

	The current code coverage results may be viewed at: 

		http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~gopal/v2fun/lcov_html/

USAGE: 

	The main way to interact with v2fun, is through the input file
	''input_file.txt'', which is parsed using the GRVY input parser. The
	parameters are detail in the input file provided. Specifically, one can
	adjust model constants, change the step size in the wall normal
	direction, and indicate which data file from the data/ directory to use
	for initial conditions. Two data files are provided with v2fun (one for
	reynolds number 180, and one for reynolds number 2000), and the README
	file in the data/ directory explains how to easily generate more.
	Additionally, a paramter for logging is include to suppress or expand
	program output.  Once the input file is to your liking, simply run v2fun
	in the source directory as, 

	> ./v2fun 

	The result of the code will written to the specified output file in
	perfect format for gnuplotting.

NOTICE

	In a future version we hope to study asymptotic error analysis, 
	and implement a method of manufactured solution.
