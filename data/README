This file explains how to extract initial condition from Moser data. Data is organized as

  		gridpoints | U | k | ep | v2 
 
and can be found in the following files: 

 gridpoints = 1st column in *mean_prof.dat = 1st column in paste
 U          = 3rd column in *mean_prof.dat = 3rd column in paste
 k          = 9th column in *vel_fluc_prof.dat = 15 in paste
 ep         = 8th column in *k_prof.dat = 23 in paste	
 v2         = 4th column in *vel_fluc_prof.dat = 10 in paste


To generate files, first clear out headers on top of files and run:  

paste LM_Channel_0180_mean_prof.dat LM_Channel_0180_vel_fluc_prof.dat LM_Channel_0180_RSTE_k_prof.dat | awk '{print $1 " " $3 " " $15 " " $23 " " $10}' > Reyn_180.dat

*** IMPORTANT *** mosers data does not compute value at y+ = 1, but we need it for interpolation so just copy the last line.
